class Model(object):
    """
    A peridynamics model.

    This class allows users to define a peridynamics system from parameters and
    a set of initial conditions (coordinates and connectivity).

    :Example: ::

        >>> from peridynamics import Model
        >>>
        >>> model = Model(
        >>>     mesh_file="./example.msh",
        >>>     horizon=0.1,
        >>>     critical_strain=0.005,
        >>>     elastic_modulus=0.05
        >>>     )

    To define a crack in the inital configuration, you may supply a list of
    pairs of particles between which the crack is.

    :Example: ::

        >>> from peridynamics import Model, initial_crack_helper
        >>>
        >>> initial_crack = [(1,2), (5,7), (3,9)]
        >>> model = Model(mesh_file, horizon=0.1, critical_strain=0.005,
        >>>               elastic_modulus=0.05, initial_crack=initial_crack)

    If it is more convenient to define the crack as a function you may also
    pass a function to the constructor which takes the array of coordinates as
    its only argument and returns a list of tuples as described above. The
    :func:`peridynamics.model.initial_crack_helper` decorator has been provided
    to easily create a function of the correct form from one which tests a
    single pair of node coordinates and returns `True` or `False`.

    :Example: ::

        >>> from peridynamics import Model, initial_crack_helper
        >>>
        >>> @initial_crack_helper
        >>> def initial_crack(x, y):
        >>>     ...
        >>>     if crack:
        >>>         return True
        >>>     else:
        >>>         return False
        >>>
        >>> model = Model(mesh_file, horizon=0.1, critical_strain=0.005,
        >>>               elastic_modulus=0.05, initial_crack=initial_crack)

    The :meth:`Model.simulate` method can be used to conduct a peridynamics
    simulation. For this an :class:`peridynamics.integrators.Integrator` is
    required, and optionally a function implementing the boundary conditions.

    :Example: ::

        >>> from peridynamics import Model, initial_crack_helper
        >>> from peridynamics.integrators import Euler
        >>>
        >>> model = Model(...)
        >>>
        >>> euler = Euler(dt=1e-3)
        >>>
        >>> indices = np.arange(model.nnodes)
        >>> model.lhs = indices[model.coords[:, 0] < 1.5*model.horizon]
        >>> model.rhs = indices[model.coords[:, 0] > 1.0 - 1.5*model.horizon]
        >>>
        >>> def boundary_function(model, u, step):
        >>>     u[model.lhs] = 0
        >>>     u[model.rhs] = 0
        >>>     u[model.lhs, 0] = -1.0 * step
        >>>     u[model.rhs, 0] = 1.0 * step
        >>>
        >>>     return u
        >>>
        >>> u, damage, *_ = model.simulate(steps=1000, integrator=euler,
        >>>                                boundary_function=boundary_function)
